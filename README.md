# 🚛 Agentic Logistics AI - Supply Chain Risk Risk Intelligence Dashboard

A dynamic AI-powered platform to detect, analyze, and visualize shipment risks across supply chains using **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and **Machine Learning**.

---

## 📖 Problem Statement

In logistics operations, predicting shipment risks is critical to reduce costs, delays, and damages. Traditional methods are static, rely heavily on manual monitoring, and cannot proactively detect dynamic risks such as carrier delays, poor conditions, or operational failures.

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview

This project builds an **Agentic AI Risk Scorer** that automatically:

- Accepts shipment data
- Analyzes and scores potential risks using selected data columns
- Visualizes risk categories (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Allows download of risk-enriched datasets
- Provides a clean, interactive dashboard for operations teams

The system is modular and can be **future expanded** to include **real-time weather** and **news-based disruptions** dynamically.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit Dashboard
- **Database:** SQLite (local)
- **Deployment:** Docker-ready
- **Model:** Basic AI Agent Risk Scorer
